Compiler construction involves designing and implementing programs that translate source code into executable code using algorithms and techniques from computer science for optimization and problem-solving.
# Compiler Construction

## Introduction
This project involves the design and implementation of a compiler that translates source code into executable code. It leverages various computer science algorithms and techniques to address challenges in software engineering and optimization.

## Features
- Lexical analysis: Tokenizing source code.
- Syntax analysis: Parsing the tokenized code.
- Semantic analysis: Checking logical consistency.
- Intermediate code generation: Abstract code representation.
- Code optimization: Enhancing efficiency.
- Code generation: Producing executable output.

## Requirements
- Programming language: [Specify, e.g., C++, Python, Java]
- Tools: [Specify tools, e.g., Flex, Bison, LLVM]

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/mahamadhusen-ce/CC-D23CE182.git]
